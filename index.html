        <h2>Who I am</h2>
        <p>
          I have ruled over and protected this county ever since the overthrow of the Wicked Witch of the South.
          I live in a palace near the southern border of the Quadling Country, attended by fifty beautiful maidens from
          each country of Oz. I am fiercely protective of my subjects in the South.
        </p>
        <p> I have demonstrated my social consciousness with the construction of a gated communities for the
          rabbits of Bunnybury and the paper dolls of Miss Cuttenclip, as well as showing a personal interest in the concerns of
          not only the humanoid Quadlings, but also the other inhabitants of my jurisdiction.
          I am experienced and seasoned to the point of knowing that there is not a magic cure for everything, and that
          certain things cannot be changed or perhaps should not be changed for better or for worse.
